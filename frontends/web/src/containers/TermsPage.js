      </p>
      <p>
        Excluding any User Content (defined below) that you may provide, you
        acknowledge that all intellectual property rights, including copyrights,
        patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, in the Website and their content

        We may suspend or terminate your access to the Website for any reason at

      </p>
      <p>
        Your use of the Website is at your own risk. The Website is provided “as

        without limitation warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
        particular purpose, non-infringement, or other violation of rights. We
        do not warrant the adequacy, currency, accuracy, likely results, or
        completeness of the Website or any third-party sites linked to or from

        they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and
        other objectionable content). Some jurisdictions may not allow the

        of such damages or loss.
