      <p>
        These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern the use of the DynaBench website (the “Website”). These Terms
        constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook,” “us,”, “we”, “our”) so it is

      <p>
        We make no representations or warranties of any kind as to the accuracy, currency, or completeness of

      </p>
      <p><strong>Ownership</strong></p>
      <p>
        Excluding any User Content (defined below) that you may provide, you acknowledge that all intellectual
        property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, in the Website and their
        content are owned by us or our suppliers. Neither these Terms nor your access to the Website transfers
        to you or any third party any rights, title or interest in or to such intellectual property rights. We
        reserve all rights not granted in these Terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        “User –Generated Content” means any information and content that a user submits to, or uses with, the

        any text, photos, videos, or other media or content.
        You assume all risks associated with the use of your User Content, including any disclosure of your User

        obligated to backup any User Content. You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own
        backup copies of your User Content if you desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to review any User Content, and to investigate and/or take

        grant us (and represent and warrant that you have the right to grant) an irrevocable, non-exclusive,
        royalty-free and fully-paid-up, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and

        User Content.
