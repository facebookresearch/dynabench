          Dynabench is a platform for dynamic data collection and benchmarking.
          Static benchmarks have many issues. Dynabench offers a more accurate
          and sustainable way for evaluating progress in AI.

          research. With the rapid pace of progress in the field, however, the
          current status quo is starting to show cracks. While it took us
          roughly 18 years to achieve "super human performance" on MNIST, the

            the time is ripe to radically rethink the way we do benchmarking

          . With Dynabench, we can collect human-in-the-loop data dynamically,{" "}
          <i>against</i> the current state-of-the-art, in a way that more
          accurately measures progress, that cannot saturate and that can
          automatically fix annotation artifacts and other biases over time.
          This is meant to address the following challenges:

            <strong>Benchmarks saturate.</strong>
            <p>
              Our field is moving so quickly that benchmarks can saturate rather
              quickly. This is problematic, because benchmarks are actually
              designed to be long-lasting: they're meant to pose a challenging
              as-yet-unattainable goal to the community. Something that is quite
              far our of reach. When a benchmark saturates, we have to go in
              search of a new, better benchmark.

              There are well-documented cases of inadvertent biases that may be
              present in datasets. For example, you can get decent performance

            <p>
              Benchmarks provide a useful common goal for the community to focus
              on, but that also means researchers may collectively overfit on
              specific tasks. Rather than keeping a clear focus on solving the
              bigger question, e.g. natural language understanding, researchers
              have built lucrative careers from cranking out percentage-point
              improvements to claim "SOTA" on established benchmarks.

            <strong>Benchmarks can be deceiving.</strong>
            <p>
              Progress can be made in science by making sure we measure the
              right thing. High accuracy on a subfield's main benchmark may look
              impressive, especially to outsiders, but this can be deceiving:
              most researchers understand that achieving superhuman performance
              on SQuAD doesn't mean that Reading Comprehension is solved.

            <p>
              Valuable time is lost when fields need to go in search of new
              benchmarks. The cyclical process of benchmarks saturating and
              getting replaced with newer ones &mdash; the "loop" of scientific
              progress &mdash; can be embraced to ensure we waste less time: by
              collecting data against the current state-of-the-art, the death of
              a saturated dynamic benchmark leads to the birth of a new,
              challenging benchmark.

            <strong>Models are now good enough.</strong>
            <p>
              Benchmarks are static for historical reasons. Up until recently,
              we did not have crowdsourcing platforms and the capability to
              serve large-scale models for inference. They were expensive to
              collect, took a long time to saturate and models had a long way to
              go. Putting humans and models in the data collection loop together
              made little sense, since models were simply too brittle. With
              recent advances, however, we think models are good enough to be
              put in the loop with humans, to measure the problem we really care
              about: how well can AI systems work together with humans.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If embraced by the community, we can, together, try to change the way
          we evaluate our systems, overcome biases and make progress towards the
          grand goals of artificial intelligence research.

        <p>
          The basic idea is that we collect human data dynamically with models
          in the loop. Humans can be tasked with finding adversarial examples
          that fool current state-of-the-art models, for example, or models can
          be cooperative and help humans find interesting examples. This offers
          two benefits: it allows us to gauge how good our current SOTA methods
          really are; and it yields data that may be used to further train even
          stronger SOTA models. The process is repeated over multiple rounds:
          each time a round gets "solved" by the SOTA, we can take those models
          and adversarially collect a new dataset where they fail. Datasets will
          be released periodically as new examples are collected.

          Won't this lead to unnatural distributions and distributional shift?

        <p>
          It very well could, if we use collected data for training (the data
          could also only be used for evaluation). Another risk is catastrophic
          forgetting or cyclical "progress", where improved models forget things
          that were relevant in an earlier round. Research is required in trying
          to understand these shifts better, in characterizing how it might
          impact learning and in overcoming any adverse effects. Remember that
          Dynabench is a scientific experiment! A few things will help, however:
          we can make sure we don't shift in the direction of one particular
          model by using ensembles as adversarial targets, by validating
          collected examples with other humans and by not discarding data from
          older rounds. That said, it is unclear to what extent a statically
          collected crowdsourced datasets are more "natural".

          Where will this lead?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We hope that it will lead to more robust models, faster progress, a
          more well-defined objective, and a better understanding of our current
          limitations.

          Can I add my own task?

          Absolutely! Please submit your proposal under "Tasks" in your user
          profile.

          are a great idea, and we would like to provide not just one, but one
          for each task round. At the same time we have to be careful about
          respecting people's privacy, different social norms and making sure
          nobody is excluded, when collecting our data. We encourage task owners
          to take this very seriously.

          What about other languages? Other modalities?
        </h2>
        <p>
          For now, the Dynabench interface is English-only but nothing stops you
          from collecting multilingual data. We also support images and audio,
          and have multimodal tasks like visual question answering. We would
          love to have more tasks in different languages and different
          modalities.

          What about annotators?

        <p>
          Anyone can use the platform to find or validate model-fooling
          examples. We hope to give linguists and other experts the tools they
          need to discover weaknesses in AI systems. We also make it easy for
          crowdworkers to generate additional data, and to validate examples, in
          the same manner.
