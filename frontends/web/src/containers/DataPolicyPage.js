        Dynabench is a collaborative research project from Facebook, Inc.
        (“Facebook,” “us,” or “our”). The aim of the Dynabench website (the
        “Website”) is to investigate the ability of AI models to make accurate
        predictions in different contexts using different terminology and
        expressions, and to determine to what extent existing AI models can
        potentially be confused or misled into making wrong predictions based on
        the wording used. The data controller responsible for the personal data
        of individuals in the European Union is Facebook Ireland Limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Data Policy describes our practices for handling your information

          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Contact information: Any data you provide us that would allow us
              to contact you, such as your name or email address. We collect
              this data directly from you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Account login information: Any data required for access to and
              management of your account, such as your user name (which need not
              be your real name), email address and password. For some areas of
              website, you will need to create an account on our Website in
              order to participate. We collect this data directly from you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Device data: Data about your computer system or other device that
              you use to access our Website including device attributes
              (information such as the operating system, hardware and software
              versions), device operations (information about operations and
              behaviors performed on the device), device identifiers (such as
              device IDs and other identifiers) and your IP address. We collect
              this data automatically.
            </li>
          </ul>
          We use the data to allow you to participate in the testing and
          benchmarking of the AI models, as well as to manage your account and
          ensure its security.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Internet or Other Similar Network Activity.</strong> This
          includes usage data such as which pages or content on our Website you
          view and for how long, and other similar data and statistics about
          your interactions, such as content response times, download errors,
          and length of visits to certain pages on our Website, as well as your
          operating system type and web browser type and version. We use this
          data for account management, personalization and security purposes. We
          collect this information automatically when you use the Website.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>
            User-generated content (such as text, audio, electronic, visual or
            similar content uploaded by the user).
          </strong>{" "}
          This includes any content or submission that you upload, post or
          otherwise share with us on our Website. Examples include any text,
          photos, videos, AI models, tasks, software, services, applications,
          datasets, or other media or content. We collect this data
          directly from you and use the data to test the ability of our existing
          AI systems to make accurate predictions, regardless of the context or
          terminology that you used.
          <br />
          We ask that you do not submit or provide any confidential, private or
          personal information when interacting with AI systems since the
          information provided may be later made public as part of an open
          source dataset that we will make available on our Website. We also ask
          that you not provide any sensitive personal information (e.g.
          information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
          religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic
          characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or
          through the Website, or otherwise to us. If you provide us with any
          sensitive personal information to us when you use the Website, we will
          use such information in accordance with this Data Policy.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Inferences.</strong> Since the purpose of the website is to
          test the ability of AI systems to make accurate predictions in
          different contexts using different terminology and expressions, we
          draw inferences from the data that you provide as user-generated
          content. We use this data to further train these AI models and systems
          and to release new datasets. If you submit to us any AI models, tasks,
          software, services, applications, or datasets, we may use such
          submissions to draw inferences based on data provided to us. As
          mentioned above in the section relating to user-generated content, we
          ask that you do not submit or provide any confidential, private or
          personal information when interacting with the AI systems.

          service providers to analyze and review interactions conducted on the
          Website using human and machine processes in order to improve,
          troubleshoot, and train AI models.
        </li>
        <li>

        discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that applicable laws may limit these rights by, for example,
        prohibiting us from providing certain information in response to an
        access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply
        with a deletion request. If we deny your request, we will communicate to
        you our decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How long do we retain this information?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, we retain your information for as long as your account is
        active or as needed to provide you the services. If you would like to
        cancel your account or delete your personal information, you may do so
        by contacting us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:dynabench@fb.com">dynabench@fb.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take measures to delete your information or keep it in a form that
        does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer
        necessary for the purposes for which we process it or when you request
        its deletion, unless we are allowed or required by law to keep the
        information for a longer period, for example to comply with our legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you request the deletion of your account, certain data (such
        as user-generated content you have uploaded or posted on the Website, as
        well as your interactions with AI systems) will remain and will not be
        deleted. As mentioned above, we take measures to delete or de-identify
        your information, such as by removing from user-generated content your
        username or email address from the author field. We are unable to change
        or delete data used to train AI systems, so you should be careful what
        information you choose to upload or post.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How do we operate and transfer data?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        We also share your information with academic and research institutions,
        as well as independent researchers, for research purposes (e.g. to
        improve AI models). Information we may share include user-generated
        content you have uploaded or posted on the Website, as well as your
        interactions with the AI systems. We do not share your account login
        information or name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Partner organizations will have access to your information only to
        perform these services on our behalf or for research purposes only and
        are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. They may
        be located, or their data processing activities may take place, in the
        United States of America or elsewhere outside the European Economic Area
        (EEA).
