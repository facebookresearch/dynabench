DynaBench is a collaborative research project from Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook,” “us,” or “our”). The aim of the DynaBench website (the “Website”) is to investigate the ability of AI models to make accurate predictions in different contexts using different terminology and expressions, and to determine to what extent existing AI models can potentially be confused or misled into making wrong predictions based on the wording used. The data controller responsible for the personal data of individuals in the European Union is Facebook Ireland Limited.
</p>
<p>
This Data Policy describes our practices for handling your information collected in connection with the Website.
</p>
<strong>
What kind of information do we collect?
</strong>
<p>
When you interact with us through the Website, we collect or receive from you the following types of information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Identifiers.</strong> This includes information such as your:
<br/>
-	Contact information: Any data you provide us that would allow us to contact you, such as your name or email address. We collect this data directly from you.
<br/>
-	Account login information: Any data required for access to and management of your account, such as your user name (which need not be your real name), email address and password. For some areas of website, you will need to create an account on our Website in order to participate. We collect this data directly from you.
<br/>
-	Device data: Data about your computer system or other device that you use to access our Website including device attributes (information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions), device operations (information about operations and behaviors performed on the device), device identifiers (such as device IDs and other identifiers) and your IP address. We collect this data automatically.
<br/>
We use the data to allow you to participate in the testing and benchmarking of the AI models, as well as to manage your account and ensure its security.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Internet or Other Similar Network Activity.</strong> This includes usage data such as which pages or content on our Website you view and for how long, and other similar data and statistics about your interactions, such as content response times, download errors, and length of visits to certain pages on our Website, as well as your operating system type and web browser type and version. We use this data for account management, personalization and security purposes. We collect this information automatically when you use the Website.
</li>

<li>
<strong>User-generated content (such as text, audio, electronic, visual or similar content uploaded by the user).</strong> This includes any content or submission that you upload, post or otherwise share with us on our Website. Examples include any text, photos, videos, or other media or content. We collect this data directly from you and use the data to test the ability of our existing AI systems to make accurate predictions, regardless of the context or terminology that you used.<br/>

We ask that you do not submit or provide any confidential, private or personal information when interacting with AI systems since the information provided may be later made public as part of an open source dataset that we will make available on our Website. We also ask that you not provide any sensitive personal information (e.g. information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Website, or otherwise to us. If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Website, we will use such information in accordance with this Data Policy.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Inferences.</strong> Since the purpose of the website is to test the ability of AI systems to make accurate predictions in different contexts using different terminology and expressions, we draw inferences from the data that you provide as user-generated content. We use this data to further train these AI models and systems and to release new datasets. As mentioned above in the section relating to user-generated content, we ask that you do not submit or provide any confidential, private or personal information when interacting with the AI systems.
</li>
</ul>

<strong>What are the sources of this information?</strong>
<p>
The categories of sources from which we have collected or received information are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You: We collect the content, communications, and other information you provide when you use the Website, including your interactions with the AI systems.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How do we use this information?</strong>
<p>
We will use the information described above for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>For research and development purposes, including training and improving AI models and developing new AI models and systems.</li>
<li>To improve our services, including analyzing how user-generated content has confused or misled AI models into making wrong predictions. We analyze and review interactions with AI systems using human and machine processes to improve, troubleshoot, and train AI systems.</li>
<li>To provide, operate and improve the Website, including establishing and maintaining your account on the Website, provide improved administration of our Website, send you service-related email communications, identify you as a user in our system and provide support and maintenance.</li>
<li>As necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities.</li>
<li>For compliance, fraud prevention, and safety purposes, including to protect our, your or others’ rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims); enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Website and protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How do we share this information?</strong>
<p>
If you choose to engage in interactions with the AI systems, you should be aware that any information you share may be read, collected, or used by other users in connection with open source datasets that we will make available for download on our Website. You should therefore use caution in disclosing any confidential, private or personal information while interacting with the AI systems.
</p>
<p>
Any submission or information that you supply as user-generated content may be accessible to others to read, collect, re-publish, and otherwise freely use and disclose. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit and we will only take down, remove, or edit user-generated content in our sole discretion, except as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation.
</p>
<p>
If you include in your user-generated content any information relating to others, you represent that you have full permission and authority to do so.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the above, there are certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorized third-party vendors and service providers. We share your information with third-party vendors and service providers who support the Website, such as by providing technical infrastructure services and data processing. In particular, we use third-party vendors and service providers to analyze and review interactions conducted on the Website using human and machine processes in order to improve, troubleshoot, and train AI models.</li>
<li>Research purposes. We share information for research purposes with academic and research institutions, as well as independent researchers. Information we may share for research purposes include user-generated content you have uploaded or posted on the Website, as well as your interactions with AI systems. We do not share your account login information or name.</li>
<li>Legal purposes. We may disclose information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, law enforcement requests, legal claims or government inquiries, detect fraud, and to protect and defend the rights, interests, safety, and security of the Website, our affiliates, owner, users, or the public.</li>
<li>Business transfers. We may share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a website, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
<li>With your consent. We may share information for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your consent.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How do we protect this information?</strong>
<p>
We take measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  However, no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network is guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted electronically and we cannot promise that your use of our Website will be completely safe.  Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and not sharing it with anyone. Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.
</p>

<strong>How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong>

<p>Depending on your country or state of residence, you have certain rights regarding the information that we have about you.</p>
<p>
Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to access, rectify, port and erase your data. You also have the right to object to and restrict certain processing of your data. This includes the right to object to our processing of your data where we are performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party.
</p>
<p>
If you are a California resident, the CCPA grants individuals whose information is governed by the CCPA the following rights:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Right of information. You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared and used your personal information during the past 12 months.</li>
<li>Right of access. You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.</li>
<li>Right of deletion. You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.
</p>
<p>
Please note that applicable laws may limit these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. If we deny your request, we will communicate to you our decision.
</p>
<strong>
How long do we retain this information?
</strong>
<p>
Generally, we retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the services. If you would like to cancel your account or delete your personal information, you may do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:dynabench@fb.com">dynabench@fb.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
We take measures to delete your information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it or when you request its deletion, unless we are allowed or required by law to keep the information for a longer period, for example to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
</p>
<p>
However, if you request the deletion of your account, certain data (such as user-generated content you have uploaded or posted on the Website, as well as your interactions with AI systems) will remain and will not be deleted. As mentioned above, we take measures to delete or de-identify your information, such as by removing from user-generated content your username or email address from the author field. We are unable to change or delete data used to train AI systems, so you should be careful what information you choose to upload or post.
</p>
