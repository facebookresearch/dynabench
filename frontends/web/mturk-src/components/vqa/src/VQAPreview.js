                        <h1>Ask Questions About Images That Fool An AI</h1>
                        <p>
                            In this task, you will be asked to find questions about an image that fool an AI model
                            into answering incorrectly. The AI is reasonably good at understanding English and interpreting images. {explain_onboarding}
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given an <b>image</b> that you will use as context, you are expected to
                            do the following:
                        </p>
                        <ol className="mx-5">
                            <li>
                                Write a <b>valid question</b> based on the image that you think the AI
                                would get <b>wrong</b> but another person would get <b>right</b>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Verify AI's answer:
                                <ul className="mx-3" style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                                    <li>
                                        If the AI's answer was correct, select the
                                        <b style={{ color: "green" }}> Correct</b> button.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If the AI's answer was incorrect, that is, the AI was successfully fooled,
                                        select the <b style={{ color: "red" }}> Incorrect</b> button
                                        and <b>provide the correct answer</b> for your question.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes AI might be tricky to fool. When you have spent 3
                            tries without success you will be able to skip to the next image by
                            clicking <b style={{ color: "blue" }}>Skip Image</b>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Completion</h3>
                        <p>
                            An HIT can be completed if you successfully <b>fool the model</b> or if you reach <b>10 tries</b>.
                            Any of those events unlock the <b>Submit HIT</b> button. You will recieve an additional bonus payment <b>only if</b> you fool the model.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Reward</h3>
                        <p>
                            On completing the HIT you will receive $0.12. If other people agreed that you fooled the model,
                            you will receive an additional bonus of $0.35. Therefore we highly encourage you to try to find creative
                            questions to fool the model.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The AI utilizes the latest technologies to understand language and can be very smart. Be creative to fool the AI - it will be fun!
