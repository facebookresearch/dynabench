We heard that you lost your Dynabench password. Sorry about that!

But don’t worry! You can use the following link to reset your password:

$ui_server_host/reset-password/$token

If you don’t use this link within 4 hours, it will expire. To get a new password reset link, visit https://dynabench.org/password_reset


Thanks,
